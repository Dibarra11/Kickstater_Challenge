# Kickstater_Challenge
Based on our analysis, we must determine how different campaigns progressed based on their launch dates and funding goals. This information will help Louise make an informed decision on when it is the best time to launch a play and with what goal to have a higher success rate. 

##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date -

The following line graph verifies that the best time to run a play campaign successfully is May through June. However, Louise should not launch a campaign during October as it has the highest failure rate at 50%.

##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line graph below shows the highest success rate at 76% for plays with a goal under $1,000. Meanwhile, plays with the highest unsuccessful rate at 100% had a goal of $45,000 to $49,000. 

###Conclusions gathered from the Outcomes based on Launch Date 

•	Choosing suitable months to run the campaign is essential to be successful.
•	Having a long campaign can impact the outcome even if the start time is adequate

###Conclusions gathered from the outcomes based on goals

•	Louise's goal has a 54% chance of being successful

###Limitations of the dataset

•	Additional data like the audience's age could impact the data.
•	Comparing the same play,  played in two countries, could be beneficial to the data.
